-   **Hexagonal Architecture**

    -   📖 **Meaning**

        -   Also known as **Ports and Adapters architecture**, Hexagonal Architecture is a software design pattern that emphasizes clear separation between the core business logic and external concerns (like web, database, APIs).
        -   The system is shaped like a hexagon to represent **equal-weighted sides** where different inputs/outputs can plug in via ports and adapters.

    -   ❓ **Why / When Use It**

        -   When you want to keep your **business logic independent of frameworks** (like Spring, databases, etc.).
        -   When you expect multiple **input/output mechanisms** (e.g., web, CLI, scheduler, messaging).
        -   When you want a **testable, clean, scalable architecture** that allows replacing infrastructure without touching core logic.
        -   Ideal for **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** or complex systems.

    -   🛠 **How to Use It**

        -   **Split the app into 3 layers:**
            1. **Core (application/domain)**
                - Contains domain models, business rules, and use case interfaces.
            2. **Ports**
                - `port/in`: Defines use case interfaces.
                - `port/out` : Defines gateway interfaces (like `UserRepository`).
            3. **Adapters**
                - `adapter/in`: Adapters like `web`, `cli`, `scheduler` call the core via `port/in`.
                - `adapter/out`: Adapters like `persistence`, `messaging`, `email` implement `port/out`.
        -   Use **dependency injection** to wire in real adapters into the service.
        -   Keep your **domain logic free from any framework (Spring, JPA, etc.)**.
        -   Add **mapper classes** between domain and entities if needed.

    -   🧠 **Examples I Practiced**

        -   `Item` (Domain)
        -   `RefrigeratorUseCase`, `ItemPort` (Ports)
        -   `RefrigeratorController` (Web In Adapter)
        -   `ItemPersistenceAdapter` (Out Adapters - Persistence)
        -   `GenerateReportScheduler`, `ConsoleLogger` (Scheduler In + Logging Out)

    -   **Summary**

        -   port/in -> usecase (interface) == implemented == domain/service -> service (class)
            -   usecase (interface) used in controller
        -   port/out -> port (interface) == implemented == adaptor/out/persistence -> persistence-adapter (class)

            -   port (interface) used in service

        -   Java 17, Spring Boot, Lombok, JPA, H2
        -   Gradle, JUnit 5
