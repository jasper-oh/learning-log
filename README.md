# 🧠 Jasper's Learning Log

Welcome to my learning lab — a space for intentional, structured, and documented experiments on my journey to becoming a better software engineer.

This repository is a continuous effort to grow my engineering skill set through hands-on exploration, reflection, and iteration — both before and after getting hired.

## 📆 Roadmap

| Phase | Focus                                          |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Backend architecture & test-driven development |
| 2     | Frontend depth & LLM integration               |
| 3     | AI service development & deployment            |
| 4     | Infrastructure & performance optimization      |

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

- `/backend-lab/` — Backend experiments and backend architecture patterns  
- `/frontend-lab/` — React, Zustand, LangChain.js, and UI/UX practices  
- `/ai-service-lab/` — FastAPI, OpenAI, Redis, and vector database integration  
- `/infra-lab/` — Kubernetes, gRPC, observability, and scalability  
- `/logs/` — Daily learning notes, reflections, and progress summaries  

## 📌 Notes

- Each experiment folder includes a `README.md` documenting:
  - Purpose
  - Technologies used
  - Problems encountered
  - Lessons learned

---

This space will grow over time as I explore deeper ideas, revisit hard topics, and build toward long-term expertise.
